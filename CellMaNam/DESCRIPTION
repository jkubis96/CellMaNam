Description: A computational tool for naming cell clusters using statistical methods, including Fisher’s exact test and occurrence-based filtering. CellMaNam identifies marker genes and annotates cell types in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data by analyzing gene occurrence patterns. It systematically determines optimal markers, refines annotations based on hierarchical relationships, and visualizes results through heatmaps, enabling precise and statistically robust cell classification.
